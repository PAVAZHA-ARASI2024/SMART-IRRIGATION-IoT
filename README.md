#SMART IRRIGATION IoT
This project is an IoT-based smart irrigation system that automates watering based on real-time soil moisture levels. It helps conserve water and ensure optimal plant health. The system uses sensors and Weather API to monitor soil conditions and climate change respectively triggers irrigation only when needed. Designed for efficient farming,it reduces manual effort and prevent overwatering.

Features
Monitors soil moisture in real time
Automates irrigation to save water
Improve crop health with efficient watering
